The Junior Mentor Program 2025 Project #1 Password-Validator

Project - In this project, I needed to create a simple password validator and had to take a few parameters into consideration and apply restrictions. 

Features - The key features of this password validator were to include:
Store the user's input in the password variable.
Check if the password is in the list of common passwords
List of common passwords
illiminate common_passwords = ["password", "123456", "123456789", "12345678", "12345", "1234567", "qwerty", "abc123", "password1", "iloveyou"]
Check if the password is valid
Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character


Tech Stack - Python

The Process - In the process of building this project, I evaluated the project, conceptualised and applied the same action. This assisted with applying clearer code because of the knowledge gained from Python concepts. There are different concepts that could be included in your program but again it is important to understand the fundamentals in order to build the password validator system. 

Lessons Learnt - I rewrote the code more than once or twice in order build a funcational project that works. This is important to achieve your desirable outcome. 

Areas of Improvements - Python concepts and functions. 

Overall Growth - Pracitise makes perfect! The more code you practise the better at it you will get, specially in Python.
